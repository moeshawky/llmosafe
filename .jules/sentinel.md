## 2024-04-13 - [C-ABI Safety: Unbounded C-string reads]
**Vulnerability:** `llmosafe_calculate_halo` uses `CStr::from_ptr` which scans indefinitely for a null-terminator. This is vulnerable to out-of-bounds reads if the caller passes an unterminated string or a memory block without a null byte.
**Learning:** For C-ABI integration, prioritize explicit length bounds and `core::slice::from_raw_parts` to prevent out-of-bounds memory reads instead of relying on unbounded C-string null-terminator scans (like `CStr::from_ptr`).
**Prevention:** Always require an explicit length argument for string pointers in FFI boundaries to bound the memory read.

## 2024-06-20 - [CRITICAL] Prevent Out-Of-Bounds Read in C-ABI via Explicit Lengths
**Vulnerability:** Unbounded C-string reads in FFI (e.g., `llmosafe_calculate_halo` using `CStr::from_ptr`) allow out-of-bounds memory reads or segmentation faults if the string is not properly null-terminated by the caller or if the string contains invalid UTF-8 bytes mixed with no null terminator.
**Learning:** In C-ABI boundaries, relying on implicit null-terminators `\0` is unsafe and prone to memory-safety bugs, especially when strings are passed from higher-level languages (like Python) or constructed manually.
**Prevention:** Always require explicitly passed length bounds (`text_len: usize`) alongside pointers in C-ABI functions and use `core::slice::from_raw_parts` to guarantee bounded, safe memory reads. Ensure `usize` correctly maps to `size_t` via `cbindgen.toml`.
## 2024-05-24 - DoS Vulnerability via Mutex Poisoning in FFI
**Vulnerability:** A `Mutex::lock().expect(...)` in `process_state_update` could panic if the lock was poisoned, leading to a crash across the FFI boundary (C-ABI) when called by host applications.
**Learning:** Panics across FFI boundaries cause undefined behavior and can trivially crash host applications, creating a Denial of Service. Rust's Mutex poisoning mechanism is a safety feature but must be handled gracefully in FFI layers.
**Prevention:** Always match on `Mutex::lock()` results in FFI exports and return appropriate C-ABI error codes (like `-6`) instead of unwrapping or expecting.
